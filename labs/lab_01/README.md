# Setting Up Cosmos DB

This lab outlines how to deploy Azure Cosmos DB with the Azure Web Portal UI and with the Azure crossplatform command line interface (CLI) for MacOS, Linux and Windows.  We will take a look at key considerations before any full/production deployment of Cosmos DB to ensure all dependent/required features of Cosmos are activated based on your applications needs for DB API/Model(s), Scale, Availablity, Replication, Consistency, Latency etc.

While some features you can tune after a Cosmos DB instance is deployed, it is always best to methodically consider what you will need/want before deploying any managed service for production use.
